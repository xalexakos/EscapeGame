</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>There is a

has significantly evolved over the past decade and today is mostly
centered on information dissemination and retrieval. Users search for
information over Google, watch videos on YouTube and share
information on Facebook. The information-centric nature of current
Internet usage has turned the network into a medium to connect people
with information or content, a distribution network conceptually
different from the communication network defined by the host-to-host
architecture principles which led to the design of IP. Some Use Cases
for sensors and machines are expected to continue to drive this model
for information sharing. There has been exponential growth of digital
information diffused over the Internet, eased by cheaper storage and
bandwidth supports, and driven by the increasing popularity of highly
demanding services, such as cloud computing or video delivery.
Nevertheless, the Internet architecture (and by extension, that of
the mobile network) is still based on the end-to-end,
connection-oriented model that can be improved in the future to more
economically address emerging trends. </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

Solution Model: </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Calibri, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
approach to address the design-usage mismatch has been to overlay
purpose-directed solutions on the existing infrastructure. A large
range of on-top solutions, such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
and peer-to-peer networks, have been designed and widely deployed to
overcome this mismatch at application layer and today carry a large
fraction of Internet traffic. The reliance on overlay solutions has
progressively increased </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT FACE="Calibri, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>complexity
in the network ecosystem created new players (e.g., CDN providers,
ISPs and content providers) and rendered overall network management a
difficult task from both the operational and business points of view.
Technical inefficiencies also emerge as consequences of the overlay
model, for example dynamic content-to-location binding, mobility
management, especially in presence of low-latency services,
multicast, multi-homing, etc. In principle, overlay solutions are
most effective when the service provided by the overlay is narrowly
directed to a specific usage model or its decoupling is required to
facilitate parallel evolution. The cost derives from the need to
manage a separate and distinct layer (which is one reason why
transport over wired portion of the mobile network infrastructure is
more costly than fixed networks). </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

expected traffic growth in the mobile segment, fostered by broadband
access penetration and powerful mobile terminals, motivates
innovation at the network layer to effectively support this increased
traffic demand. Information Centric Networking (ICN) and its
implementations, Named-Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric
Networking (CCN), identify a new networking paradigm that leverages
content awareness at the network layer to simplify the network
architecture. Network operations are driven by content names, rather
than location identifiers (IP addresses) to gracefully enable
user-to-content communication. </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

the content name into network primitives allows for a more agile
connectionless transport model driven by the end-user that is not
bound to a network addressable interface. This simplifies the
management of multi-homed communication (mobile and fixed) and
provides autonomous control of forwarding based on factors such as
congestion and local cache states. Due to content-awareness carried
by content names, the network is able to route requests toward
nearest content replicas, exploiting temporary in-network caches and
adaptive request routing for a more efficient and cost-effective data
delivery. Finally, the symmetric-routing attribute endows the
networking layer with natural mobility support. The inclusion of
support for mobility, security and storage in the networking layer
leads to a simpler, cost-efficient architecture that intrinsically
supports modern communication usage patterns. </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT SIZE=4>ICN architectural
principles are designed to build an agile network substrate that can
accommodate future innovation either at the network and application
layers in a scalable manner. While ICN design addresses fundamental
aspects of the network architecture, the benefits of its use can be
illustrated by the following use cases: </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Content delivery:
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>The natural application of ICN is content
dissemination and delivery, especially mobile content delivery, where
network edge caching can considerably enhance delivery performance.
According to user requests and hence content popularity over time,
the content moves in time and in space due to the symmetric routing
and in-network caching principles. Unlike traditional CDNs where
request routing requires centralized orchestration for load-balancing
purposes and where content placement requires complex optimization
tools, the distribution of content in caches close to the edge is
automatically triggered by user requests in ICN. Request load
balancing and multipath forwarding can be achieved by concurrent use
of multiple network interfaces in parallel at the receiver (e.g., in
the context of multi-homing) and by hop-by-hop forwarding performed
at ICN routers. This results in important latency and bandwidth
reduction in addition to simplifying network management. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Sensor Networks/IoT:
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>The current host-centric TCP/IP model appears
not suitable for large distributed and low-power devices: a richer
naming, for data, applications and devices is needed to simplify the
communication model. Also, the communication is naturally one-to-many
or many-to-one device over a largely distributed network. ICN is
considered a promising network-layer candidate for its namings, but
additionally for its light transport model and highly distributed
forwarding. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Disaster Scenarios
and Network Resilience: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>Unpredictable natural
disaster or human-caused disasters like a terrorist attacks have
shown that the current network infrastructure is vulnerable and
mobile communications play a fundamental role in recovering such
failures in the infrastructure. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT SIZE=4>The challenges faced in
the aftermath of a disaster are the automatic reconfiguration of
fragmented networks, an accrued congestion of the available network
resources and an authentication to be managed in a decentralized
manner. ICN has recently appeared as a promising candidate due to its
connectionless and receiver-driven transport which does not require a
connection setup, nor an end-to-end routing information. Interest can
be routed by adopting an hop-by-hop forwarding strategy based upon
incomplete network knowledge and satisfied by distributed in-network
storage capabilities. The security model associated to objects rather
than channels also result very appealing in such scenarios. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Smart Cities
(healthcare, energy distribution, vehicular networks, etc.): </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4>The
capability of ICN to cope with a dynamic, mobile and often
infrastructure-less network make it suitable for supporting the
development of new applications meant to facilitate our daily life:
e-health, intelligent transportation system, smart energy
distribution systems are emerging in the broader context of smart
cities. The challenges ICN may effectively relieve are here those of
scalable distribution of information in a mobile and failure-prone
environment, again the data-centric security model and the
service-aware Quality of Experience that can be tuned and enforced in
the network by leveraging content names. The latter aspect would be
critical for accommodating services with widely different
requirements on top of the same distribution and caching network
infrastructure.</FONT></P>
